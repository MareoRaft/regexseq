SQL stuff
-----------------
remember to COMMIT your changes


example PL/SQL block:

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON; 
DECLARE
  myvarname varchar2(255) := 'before';
BEGIN
  dbms_system.get_env('TZ', myvarname);
  dbms_output.put_line('begin');
  dbms_output.put_line(myvarname);
  dbms_output.put_line('put_line is working');
END;

DataGuard - an Oracle tool that helps sync primary and standby CDBs, among other things.
ORACLE_SID - The Oracle system identifier.
sqlplus - SQL Plus (sql client CLI)
srvctl - server control (main Oracle CLI)
dgmgrl - Data Guard ManaGeR repL ? (Data Guard CLI REPL)

timesheets / time off
------------------------

company(client) time logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This tracks hours WORKED.  Hence Holidays, Furlough Days, PTO Days, and sick days are marked 0.

For FURLOUGH days AND HOLIDAYS, put a "0" in the FURLOUGH day category.

For PTO Days and Sick Days, just leave it blank.


eazytyme
~~~~~~~~
This tracks hours BILLED TO CLIENT.  This is almost identical to beeline.  Holidays and Furlough days are marked 0.  PTO days and Sick days have a special designation and are marked with 8 in their designation.







ORACLE TOOLS
-------------
/etc/oratab






Oracle DB lookup / Oracle DBs / Oracle Databases
---------------------------------------------------
If you need the Hostname or Port for a CDB or PDB, look it up with the "tnsping" utility on any machine that has Oracle installed (just include $ORACLE_HOME/bin in your path, and then run `tnsping <db_unique_name>`).

NOTE ALSO the utilities sqlplus, srvctl, and dgmgrl are in the same place.

more oracle
--------------------------------------
- Given a CDB unique name, figure out the ORACLE_HOME:
grep <cdb_unique_name> /etc/oratab
Each line is formatted as ORACLE_SID:ORACLE_HOME:should_db_launch_at_sys_startup


- Given a CDB unique name, determine where it is located (which cluster nodes it's on):
log onto an Oracle VM
    ssh user@host
    bash
(add tnsping to the PATH)
    (source ~/.bash_profile)
use tnsping
    tnsping <<cdb unique name>>


- Check whether the CDB is running:
You can try connecting to it via SQLDeveloper

- Gracefully start or stop a CDB
https://oracle-base.com/articles/12c/multitenant-startup-and-shutdown-cdb-and-pdb-12cr1
SHUTDOWN; -- doesn't seem to do anything
STARTUP;
srvctl stop database -db <<cdb unique name>>
srvctl start database -db <<cdb unique name>>
-- works!




- Given a CDB unique name, find the important properties about the database (what nodes it is running on, what resources it is allocated in terms of CPU/memory)
https://oracle-base.com/articles/12c/multitenant-resource-manager-cdb-and-pdb-12cr1

- Get the ORACLE_HOME
First, logon to the server that holds the DB in question.  Then,
    dbhome <SID>
    dbhome <<cdb unique name>>
if it outputs "/home/oracle", that means it couldn't find the SID.


- Figure out if a CDB is primary or standby:
select sys_context('userenv','DATABASE_ROLE') DATABASE_ROLE FROM dual;


- Delete the logs because it got too full:
rman target "sqluser/sqlpassword@host:port/<<cdb unique name>>"
crosscheck archivelog all;
delete archivelog all;
exit

- Change the TZ env timezone
srvctl setenv database -d <<cdb_unique_name>> -T TZ='Asia/Yerevan'

- enable/disable a trigger
alter trigger MYTABLE.MY_TRIGGER ENABLE;
alter trigger MYTABLE.MY_TRIGGER DISABLE;


- Check the running status of instances/services:
srvctl status service -d <<cdb unique name>>

- Force close a pdb and open:
alter pluggable database <<pdb name>> close immediate instances=all;
alter pluggable database <<pdb name>> open read only instances=all;

I'd say the most important utilities you might want to tinker around with are:

- SQL*Plus
  * SQL client CLI REPL that comes with oracle software
  * `sqlplus` is a command that you can execute on the Oracle VM itself
  * sqlplus -L user/password@host:port/<<cdb unique name>> as sysdba
  * sqlplus -L user/password@host:port/<<cdb unique name>>

- srvctl
  * server CLI
  * a tool to show the status of, start, and stop all of the instances of a CDB on a cluster
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RACAD/GUID-C2D37BAB-DA98-49B4-A777-F2B3AA8D2E7A.htm#RACAD5006

- dgmgrl
  * the tool that manages the dataguard configuration
  * CLI REPL
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28295/dgmgrl.htm
  * dgmgrl <user>/<pass>@<<cdb unique name>>
